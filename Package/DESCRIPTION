Description: For players/DMs in Dungeons and Dragons. Enter an attack modifier,  enemy AC, and see if the attack hits or misses. It "rolls" the 20 sided dice for you (by picking a random number from 1-20), adds your modifier, and sees if that result is greater than or equal to the enemy AC. A "tie" is a "miss", per the rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
