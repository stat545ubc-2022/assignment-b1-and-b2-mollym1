## Assignment B1 info

- creating a function, uploading to Git, using roxygen, testing
  functions.
- my function is for Dungeons and Dragons: you can enter your “attack
  modifier” and “enemy AC” into the function. It will “roll a d20” for
  you and say if your attack hits or misses

- creating an R package (in this case, a dice roller for Dungeons and
  Dragons that does attack rolls)
